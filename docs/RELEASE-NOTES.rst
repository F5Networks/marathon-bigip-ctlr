* :issues:`314` - Support new health-check protocols (MESOS_HTTP, MESOS_HTTPS, and MESOS_TCP) introduced in DC/OS 1.10.

Limitations
```````````
* If an older controller created resources, upgrading to the new version could result in a python exception when
  adding metadata to virtuals: :issues:`339`

v1.2.2

v1.2.0
------

Added Functionality
```````````````````
* Support for BIG-IP partitions with non-zero default route domains.
* Added build and version information to the User-Agent header of iControl REST requests to BIG-IP.
* Build and version information logged upon container startup.

Bug Fixes
`````````
* :issues:`256` - Adds correct Marathon healthCheck path to BIG-IP Health Monitor Send String
* :cccl-issue:`198` - Corrected a comparison problem in CCCL that caused unnecessary updates for BIG-IP Virtual Server resources

Limitations
```````````
* If you are deploying services using the F5-supported iApps, you must upgrade to a version that supports
  route domain 0 for non-Common partitions. The minimum versions required for the F5 iapps are:

  - f5.http: ``f5.http.v1.3.0rc3``
  - f5.tcp: ``f5.tcp.v1.0.0rc3``

  You can find these versions in the iapp package ``iapps-1.0.0.492.0``. To upgrade, you must perform the following:

  - `Download and install the latest iApps templates`_.
  - `Set the service to use the newer iApp template`_.

v1.1.1
------

Bug Fixes
`````````
* Supports API changes introduced with Marathon v1.5.2 :issues:`244`
* Gracefully handle the case when an app has no service ports (applies to DC/OS Virtual Networks)
* Removed immutable parameters from update operations, as BIG-IP v11.6.1 does not allow immutable parameters to be present in update operations.
* Added enhanced exception handling to catch invalid input configurations in CCCL.

v1.1.0
------

Added Functionality
```````````````````
* iApp and virtual server parameters are now mutually exclusive. This addresses a previous limitation in v1.0.0.
* Creates detached pools if virtual server bind addresses not specified.
* Container image size reduced from 321MB to 82MB.
* Can use local and non-local BIG-IP users.
* Supports multiple BIG-IP health monitors for each Marathon application Service Port.
* Wildcard (*) for F5_CC_PARTITIONS Configuration Parameter is no longer supported.

v1.0.0
------

Added Functionality
```````````````````
* Can manage multiple BIG-IP partitions in the following environments
  * Apache Mesos/Marathon
  * Mesosphere DC/OS Enterprise
* Manages the following LTM resources for the BIG-IP partition(s)
  * Virtual Servers
  * Virtual Addresses
  * Pools
  * Pool Members
  * Nodes
  * Health Monitors
  * Application Services
* Auth0-based authentication for DC/OS Enterprise

Limitations
```````````
* Command line parameter alternatives to the environment variables are not documented in the user guide.
* Cannot share endpoints managed in the partition controlled by the |mctlr-long| with endpoints managed in another partition.
* iApp and virtual server parameters are not treated as being mutually exclusive. You should not specify both, otherwise the BIG-IP may be improperly configured.
* The deployment of the controller will fail if the BIG-IP is not available when the controller starts.
* Parameters other than IPAddress and Port (e.g. Connection Limit) specified in the iApp Pool Member Table apply to all members of the pool.
* Health monitor timeout is not described in documentation
